#load data from data/sanger.csv into a variable called "data"


#create a subset called MCF7 and MDA
#containing only data from MCF7 or MDA-MB-231


#subset the data further to only contain TAMOXIFEN data with a dose of 5
#call the new variables MCF7_Tamoxifen and MDA_Tamoxifen

#calculate the mean "viability" difference between the two groups previously defined
#assign the result to viability_diff

#perform a t test using t.test() between the two groups previously defined
#save the response to viability_ttest
